RocketLib Toolkit v1.1
By Leslie E. Krause

RocketLib Toolkit is a purely Lua-driven SQLite3 map reader with an extensive API for 
analysis of map databases. The library is intended primarily for use by server operators,
but anybody with Lua programming experience can develop their own command-line tools.

Just to showcase how easy it is to get started examining your map database, it takes only 
15 lines of Lua code to search for all mapblocks that have dropped items:

   require( "maplib" )

   local map_db = MapDatabase( "~/.minetest/worlds/world/map.sqlite", false )

   for index, block in map_db.iterate( ) do
           local count = 0
           for i, v in ipairs( block.object_list ) do
                   if v.name == "__builtin:item" then
                           count = count + 1
                   end
           end
           if count > 0 then
                   print( string.format( "%d dropped items in mapblock (%s)", 
                           count, index_to_string( index )
                   ) )
           end
   end

Important: If your map database exceeds 1GB in size, then a RAM-disk (tmpfs on Linux) is 
strongly recommended for optimal performance. Based on personal experience, there can be
upwards of a ten-fold improvement in speed, particularly for intensive queries.

The map reader library provides a fully object-oriented API, so it is straightfoward to 
examine mapblocks and their contents without having to worry about the underlying 
database architecture.

The available class constructors are as follows:

   BlobReader( input )
   Provides an interface to serially parse a BLOB with a variety of known datatypes.

    * input is the BLOB to parse, typically the raw mapblock data obtained from the 
      "data" field of the "blocks" table

   The BlobReader class defines the following public methods:

      BlobReader::read_u8( )
      Read an 8-bit unsigned integer and advance the pointer by one byte.

      BlobReader::read_u16( )
      Read a 16-bit unsigned integer and advance the pointer by two bytes.

      BlobReader::read_u32( )
      Read a 32-bit unsigned integer and advance the pointer by four bytes.

      BlobReader::read_s16( )
      Read a 16-bit signed integer and advance the pointer by two bytes.

      BlobReader::read_s32( )
      Read a 32-bit signed integer and advance the pointer by four bytes.

      BlobReader::read_f1000( )
      Read a floating point and advance the pointer by four bytes.

      BlobReader::read_v3f1000( )
      Read a 3-dimensional floating point array and advance the pointer by 12 bytes.

      BlobReader::read_zlip( )
      Slurp a zlib compressed data stream and advance the pointer accordingly.

      BlobReader::read_string( len )
      Read a non-terminated text string of len bytes and then advance the pointer 
      accordingly to len. If len is not provided, slurp a multiline terminated text 
      string and advance the pointer accordingly.

   MapArea( pos1, pos2 )
   Delineates a mapblock area to be examined, while also providing various area 
   calculation methods.

    * pos1 is lowest boundary mapblock coordinate to iterate
    * pos2 is the highest boundary mapblock coordinate to iterate

   The MapArea class provides the following public methods:

      MapArea::get_min_pos( )
      Return the lowest boundary mapblock position of the area as a table {x,y,z}

      MapArea::get_max_pos( )
      Return the highest boundary mapblock position of the area as a table {x,y,z}

      MapArea::get_volume( )
      Calculate the volume of the area in cubic mapblocks and return the result

      MapArea::has_index( idx )
      Returns true if the specified mapblock hashed position, idx, exists within the area

      MapArea::has_pos( pos )
      Returns true if the specified mapblock position, pos, exists within the area

      MapArea::iterate( )
      Returns an iterator for looping through the area

   MapBlock( blob, is_preview, get_checksum )
   Parses the mapblock data and calculates the associated checksum. For efficiency, the 
   nodemeta list and the node list are not parsed automatically, but they can be obtained 
   using the corresponding methods.

    * blob is the raw mapblock data obtained from "data" field of the "blocks" table
    * is_preview is a boolean indicating whether to parse the BLOB (optional).
    * get_checksum is the checksum function to calculate the checksum and length of the 
      BLOB (optional).

   The MapBlock class defines the following public methods:

      MapBlock::get_node_list( )
      Parses the raw node list of the mapblock and returns a node_list table.

      The node_list table is an array of exactly 4096 elements, corresponding to the 
      16x16x16 matrix of nodes comprising the mapblock. The coordinates of a node can be 
      obtained using the decode_node_pos( ) helper function. Each entry of the node_list 
      table contains a subtable with three fields: id, param1, and param2.

      Note that the id refers to the content ID which varies between map blocks. You must 
      cross-reference the content ID to determine the actual registered node name.

      MapBlock::get_nodemeta_map( )
      Parses the raw nodemeta list and returns a nodemata_list table.

      The nodemeta_map table is an associative array indexed by the position hash of 
      the corresponding node from the node_list table. Each entry of the nodemeta_list 
      table is a subtable containing the following fields:e

       * fields is a subtable containing the user-defined metadata for the node, as 
         ordinary key-value pairs.
       * is_private is a boolean specifying whether the metadata of the node is private
       * inventory is a subtable containing the inventory of the node as an array of 
         tables, with two fields for each inventory slot: item_name and item_count

   The MapBlock class defines the following public read-only properties:

      MapBlock::version
      The version of the mapblock.

      MapBlock::flags
      The flags of the mapblock.

      MapBlock::content_width
      The size of the content_ids in bytes. This is either 1 or 2, based on the version.

      MapBlock::params_width
      The size of param1 and param2 in bytes. This is always 2.

      MapBlock::object_list
      An array of objects stored in the mapblock. Each entry contains a subtable with 
      seven fields: type, pos, version, name, staticdata, hp, velocity, and yaw.

      MapBlock::nodename_map
      An associative array of registered node names indexed by content IDs.

      MapBlock::timestamp
      The timetamp when the mapblock was last modified by the engine. Note that this 
      value is not necessarily a reliable means to determine if a mapblock was changed or 
      not. For that you should perform a checksum comparison.

   MapDatabase( path, is_preview, summary )
   Opens an existing map.sqlite database from disk and prepares the necessary SQL statements.

    * path is the path to the sqlite3 map database to be opened in read-only mode
    * is_preview is a boolean indicating whether mapblocks are to be parsed by default 
      (optional)
    * is_summary is a boolean indicating whether checksums apply to all mapblocks by 
      default (optional)

   The MapDatabase class defines the following public methods:

      MapDatabase::enable_preview( )
      Enable parsing of mapblocks by default

      MapDatabase::disable_preview( )
      Disable parsing of mapblocks by default, only calculate checksum and length

      MapDatabase::enable_summary( )
      Enable cumulative checksum calculations by default

      MapDatabase::disable_summary( )
      Disable cumulative checksum calculations by default

      MapDatabase::change_algorithm( algorithm )
      Switches to a different checksum algorithm, either 'adler32' or 'crc32'.

      MapDatabase::create_cache( use_memory, on_step )
      Create a cache database storing cross-references of mapblock position hashes, 
      thereby speeding up successive queries. If use_memory is true, the cache database 
      will be memory resident. Otherwise a file named "map.sqlite-cache" will be created 
      in the same directory as the map database. The optional on_step hook can be used to 
      update a progress bar for lengthy operations.

      MapDatabase::get_length( )
      Returns the total number of mapblocks. If the cache is available, then it will be 
      used.

      MapDatabase::get_area_length( area )
      Returns the total number of mapblocks inside the given area. The cache is required 
      for this operation.

      MapDatabase::iterate( on_step )
      Returns an iterator function, for looping over all existing mapblocks. The optional 
      on_step hook can be used to update a progress bar for length operations

      MapDatabase::iterate_area( area, on_step )
      Returns an iterator function, for looping over all existing mapblocks inside the 
      given area. The optional on_step hook can be used to update a progress bar for 
      lengthy operations. The cache is required for this operation.

      MapDatabase::select( on_step )
      Returns an array of all hashed positions for all mapblocks. The optional on_step 
      hook can be used to update a progress bar for lengthy operations. The cache is not 
      used for this operation (but I will consider making it optional)

      MapDatabase::select_area( area, on_step )
      Returns an array of hashed positions for all mapblocks inside the given area. The 
      optional on_step hook can be used to update a progress bar for lengthy operations. 
      The cache is required for this operation.

      MapDatabase::has_index( index )
      Returns a boolean indicating whether a mapblock exists at the given hashed 
      position.

      MapDatabase::get_mapblock( index, get_checksum )
      Returns the mapblock at the given hashed position as a MapBlock object. The 
      optional get_checksum function will be used to calculate the checksum and length 
      of the BLOB.

      MapDatabase::get_mapblock_raw( index, get_checksum )
      Returns the mapblock as a BLOB, without calculating the checksum.

      MapDatabase::close( index, get_checksum )
      Closes the map database (but it doesn't close the cache database, which is a known 
      unresolved bug).

Several helper functions are also available for debugging and conversion purposes.

   decode_pos( index )
   Converts the given mapblock hashed position to a vector position.

   encode_pos( pos )
   Converts the given mapblock vector position to a hashed position.

   decode_node_pos( node_index, index )
   Converts the given node index within the given mapblock to a vector position in world 
   coordinates. If the index parameter is not provided, then the result will be relative 
   to a mapblock at {0,0,0}. Note: For consistency with Lua conventions, node indexes 
   are always 1-based.

   encode_node_pos( node_pos )
   Converts the given node vector position into a both a node index and mapblock hashed 
   position.

   encode_pos( pos )
   Converts the given mapblock vector position to a hashed position.

   pos_to_string( pos )
   Returns a string representing the given vector position as "x,y,z".

   dump( buffer )
   Returns a string representing a memory dump of the given buffer
